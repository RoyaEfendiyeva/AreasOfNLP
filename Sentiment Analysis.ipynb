    "Polarity and subjectivity are two main indicators used in sentiment analysis. These indicators are used to evaluate the feeling and objectivity in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Polarity:\n",
    "Translation: Indicates whether the feeling is positive or negative.\n",
    "Meaning: Polarity indicates whether the overall feeling in the text is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "Positive Polarity (between 0 and 1): The text is dominated by a positive feeling. For example, \"This project is very interesting and successful.\"\n",
    "Negative Polarity (between 0 and -1): The text is dominated by a negative feeling. For example, \"This product is very weak and bad.\"\n",
    "Neutral Polarity (0): The text does not have any strong feelings. For example, \"The teacher will start the lesson at 10 o'clock.\"\n",
    "-----> I absolutely love working on creative projects! The challenges are exciting, and the process is incredibly rewarding. Every day is a new opportunity to learn and grow.\n",
    "-----> I am very disappointed with the recent changes. The service has been consistently poor, and it feels like no one is taking responsibility for the issues. This has been a frustrating experience.\n",
    "-----> The meeting is scheduled for 3 PM tomorrow. We will review the quarterly reports and discuss the upcoming deadlines. Please make sure to have all relevant documents prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subjectivity (Objectivity):\n",
    "Translation: Indicates whether the text is subjective (personal thoughts and feelings) or objective (based on facts).\n",
    "Meaning: Subjectivity refers to the extent to which personal opinions, thoughts, and feelings dominate the text.\n",
    "High Subjectivity (between 0 and 1): Personal opinions and feelings are present in the text. For example, \"Today is a very nice day.\"\n",
    "Low Subjectivity (between 0 and -1): The text contains objective facts and information. For example, \"Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey.\""
